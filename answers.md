a8 questions:

1)
- they all have a board in which cards are placed
- they all certain possible plays that the player can make
- they all have plays in which cards add up to a certain number

- they have different sized boards
- they have diffrent combinations of cards that are possible plays

2)
- you can create these variables by initializing them in the Board parameters, e.g. (Board(size, ranks, suits, poimtValues)), all for the levens board specifically

3)
- no, because although ElevensBoard is automatically a Board, a Board isn't automatically an ElevensBoard, so it wouldn't make sense if its methods were exactly those of an ElevensBoard
